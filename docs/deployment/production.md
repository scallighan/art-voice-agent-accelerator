# Production Deployment Guide

!!! warning "Demo vs Production"
    This accelerator provides a **simplified infrastructure** designed for learning and demonstration purposes. Production deployments require significant additional hardening, security controls, and architectural considerations outlined in this guide.

---

## Current State

The accelerator implements a "flat" architecture optimized for rapid deployment and experimentation:

| Component | Demo Implementation | Production Requirement |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Networking** | Optional VNet integration and private endpoints | Private endpoints with a private deployment runner |
| **Authentication** | Basic scaffolding | Full identity management, MFA |
| **API Gateway** | Direct container access | API Management with rate limiting |
| **Message Queuing** | In-process handling | Managed messaging service |
| **Observability** | Application Insights | Full monitoring stack with alerting |

---

## Security Hardening

### Network Perimeter

Production deployments should isolate all services within a private network:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Internet
        Users[Callers]
    end
    
    subgraph Azure["Azure Network Perimeter"]
        subgraph PublicZone["DMZ"]
            AppGW[Application Gateway]
        end
        
        subgraph PrivateZone["Private VNet"]
            Apps[Container Apps]
            ACS[ACS]
            Redis[Redis Cache]
            Cosmos[Cosmos DB]
            APIM[API Management]
            Speech[Speech Services]
            AOAI[Azure OpenAI]
        end
    end
    
    Users --> AppGW
    AppGW --> Apps
    Apps --> ACS
    Apps --> Redis
    Apps --> Cosmos
    Apps --> APIM
    APIM --> Speech
    APIM --> AOAI
```

#### Application Gateway for SSL Termination

Use Azure Application Gateway as the ingress point for all HTTP/WebSocket traffic:

- Centralized SSL/TLS termination with managed certificates
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) for threat protection
- Path-based routing and load balancing
- Health probes for backend availability

    - [End-to-end TLS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ssl-overview)

#### API Management as AI Gateway

Azure API Management provides critical controls for AI workloads:

| Capability | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Rate Limiting** | Prevent resource exhaustion and cost overruns |
| **Token Counting** | Track and limit Azure OpenAI token consumption |
| **Request Transformation** | Normalize requests across different AI models |
| **Caching** | Cache common responses to reduce latency and cost |
| **Circuit Breaking** | Graceful degradation when backends fail |

!!! info "Documentation"
    - [API Management Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts)
    - [AI Gateway Capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/genai-gateway-capabilities)
    - [Token Rate Limiting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/azure-openai-token-limit-policy)

#### Private Endpoints

Set `TF_VAR_enable_private_endpoints=true` to create:

- A VNet-injected Container Apps environment
- A dedicated private-endpoint subnet
- Private DNS zones and VNet links
- Private endpoints for Key Vault, App Configuration, ACR, Blob Storage,
  Cosmos DB MongoDB vCore, Azure Managed Redis, and AI Foundry/Voice Live

```bash
azd env set TF_VAR_enable_private_endpoints true
azd env set TF_VAR_disable_public_network_access false
azd provision --preview
azd provision
azd deploy
```

The first enablement replaces the Container Apps environment because an existing
environment cannot be moved into a VNet in place. Plan for deployment downtime.
The preprovision hook automatically limits Key Vault's public administration path
to the current deployment client's IPv4 address.

`TF_VAR_disable_public_network_access=false` keeps control-plane deployment
compatible with local `azd` and its postprovision hooks while application traffic
uses private DNS and private endpoints. Set it to `true` only when Terraform,
App Configuration updates, and image builds run from a private network runner.

ACR public access remains independently controlled by
`TF_VAR_acr_public_network_access_enabled`. The default is `true` because `azd`
remote builds cannot push to a private-only registry without a private build
agent pool. Azure Communication Services does not currently expose a private-link
resource for the Communication Service endpoint, so it remains protected with
managed identity/RBAC and service-level authentication. Azure Managed Redis uses
its private endpoint for application connectivity, but its current resource API
does not expose a public-network-disable property.

Supported Azure services should be accessed via private endpoints:

| Service | Documentation |
|---------|---------------|
| Azure Communication Services | [ACS Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/networking/private-link) |
| Azure Cache for Redis | [Redis Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-private-link) |

### Authentication Architecture

!!! note "Current State"
    The accelerator provides **scaffolding** for authentication flows (see [Authentication Guide](../security/authentication.md)), but production implementations require building out the full identity management layer.

Production authentication should include:

1. **Azure Entra ID** for operator/admin access
2. **Managed Identity** for all service-to-service communication
3. **Call Authentication** via DTMF, SIP headers, or external IDP
4. **Session Validation** with secure token management

    - [ACS Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/authentication)
    - [Key Vault for Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview)

## Scalability Patterns

### Managed Messaging for Backpressure

The demo implementation handles message flow in-process, which limits scalability and resilience. Production deployments should introduce managed messaging services:

| Service | Use Case | Benefits |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Azure Service Bus** | Command/event queuing | Dead-letter support, transactions, ordering |
| **Azure SignalR Service** | WebSocket management | Connection offloading, auto-scaling |
| **Azure Event Hubs** | High-throughput streaming | Partitioned ingestion, replay capability |

These services address:

- **Connection Management** - Handle thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections
- **Backpressure Handling** - Queue-based buffering prevents overload
- **Failure Isolation** - Failed processing doesn't block healthy flows
- **Horizontal Scaling** - Stateless workers scale independently

!!! info "Documentation"
    - [Service Bus Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview)
    - [SignalR Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-overview)
    - [Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about)

### Container Apps Configuration

```yaml
scale:
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 20
  rules:
    - name: http-requests
      http:
        metadata:
          concurrentRequests: "50"
    - name: cpu-utilization
      custom:
        type: cpu
        metadata:
          value: "70"
```

## Observability

### Monitoring Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Application Insights** | Distributed tracing, request logging |
| **Azure Monitor** | Infrastructure metrics, alerting |
| **Log Analytics** | Centralized log aggregation |
| **Dashboards** | Real-time operational visibility |

### Key Metrics

| Category | Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Latency | End-to-end response | < 2.5s | > 4s |
| Latency | STT processing | < 500ms | > 1s |
| Latency | TTS generation | < 1s | > 2s |
| Availability | Service uptime | 99.9% | < 99.5% |
| Quality | Call drop rate | < 1% | > 2% |
| Resources | Container CPU | < 70% | > 85% |
| Resources | Redis memory | < 70% | > 80% |

### Correlation

Ensure all logs include correlation identifiers:

- `callConnectionId` - ACS call identifier
- `sessionId` - Application session
- `requestId` - Individual request tracking

## Cost Optimization

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Right-sizing** | Start with minimum SKUs, scale based on usage |
| **Reserved Capacity** | 1-year reservations for predictable workloads |
| **Auto-scaling** | Scale down during off-peak hours |
| **Caching** | Cache TTS responses and common AI completions |
| **Idle Timeout** | End idle sessions after 60 seconds |

### Cascade Architecture with Fine-Tuned SLMs

For production workloads, consider implementing a **cascade architecture** that routes requests through progressively capable models:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Request[Incoming Request] --> Router[Intent Router]
    Router --> SLM[Fine-Tuned SLM]
    Router --> LLM[GPT-4o]
    SLM --> Response[Response]
    LLM --> Response
```

| Tier | Model | Use Case | Cost Profile |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Tier 1** | Fine-tuned Phi-3/SLM | Common intents, FAQ responses | Low |
| **Tier 2** | GPT-4o-mini | Moderate complexity, structured outputs | Medium |
| **Tier 3** | GPT-4o | Complex reasoning, multi-turn context | High |

Benefits of cascade routing:

- **80-90% cost reduction** by handling common queries with SLMs
- **Lower latency** for simple requests (SLMs respond faster)
- **Graceful fallback** when SLM confidence is low
- **Domain specialization** through fine-tuning on your conversation data

## Context Management

### Structured Memory and Context Optimization

Large language models have finite context windows. Production deployments should implement structured memory patterns to optimize token usage and maintain conversation coherence:

| Pattern | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Hierarchical Summarization** | Summarize older turns, keep recent turns verbatim | Reduces tokens while preserving context |
| **Semantic Chunking** | Store conversation segments by topic/intent | Enables selective retrieval |
| **Memory Tiering** | Hot (Redis) → Warm (Cosmos) → Cold (Blob) | Cost-effective storage with fast access |
| **Entity Extraction** | Extract and persist key entities separately | Compact context representation |

Consider exploring:

- **Azure AI Foundry** for managed memory and agent orchestration
- **Semantic Kernel** for structured memory plugins
- **Custom embeddings** for conversation similarity search

## Evaluations

### Quality Assurance for AI Agents

Production AI agents require systematic evaluation to ensure quality, safety, and alignment with business objectives.

!!! note "Current State"
    The accelerator includes evaluation scaffolding in [samples/labs/dev/evaluation_playground.ipynb](../../samples/labs/dev/evaluation_playground.ipynb). This provides a starting point for building comprehensive evaluation pipelines.

#### Evaluation Dimensions

| Dimension | Metrics | Tools |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Fluency** | Coherence, grammar, naturalness | Azure AI Evaluation SDK |
| **Groundedness** | Factual accuracy, hallucination detection | Promptflow evaluators |
| **Relevance** | Response appropriateness, intent alignment | Custom evaluators |
| **Safety** | Content filtering, PII detection | Azure AI Content Safety |
| **Latency** | End-to-end response time, P95 targets | Application Insights |

#### Recommended Approach

1. **Baseline Metrics** - Establish performance benchmarks before changes
2. **Golden Dataset** - Curate representative conversations with expected outputs
3. **Automated Pipelines** - Run evaluations on every deployment
4. **Human-in-the-Loop** - Periodic manual review of edge cases
5. **A/B Testing** - Compare model/prompt variations in production
